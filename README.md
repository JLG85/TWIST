The main learning objective for this project was to learn how to build a website from the back end  to the front end.

My part in the project was doing the HTML part for the pages of the website.

The challenges I ran into had to do with tying the code into the HTML. Also that the order in which I did things was important.

Some of the admin parts are missing that would make the site more convenient for the user.

I think if we were to start over I would be more detailed about writing down all the little things that got skipped over. Also I would log our hours working on project.
